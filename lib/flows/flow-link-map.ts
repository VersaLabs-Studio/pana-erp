// lib/flows/flow-link-map.ts
// Obsidian ERP v4.0 — Flow Link Map (master §12.6 + 2N Part 1.1).
//
// The single source of truth for "how to resolve a `to` document given I'm at
// a `from` document with name `X`" for every ordered doctype pair in the
// three live flows (Lead-to-Cash, Procure-to-Pay, the manufacturing spine).
//
// Replaces the ad-hoc per-page `stageStatuses` blocks and the parallel
// back-link table in `flow-adjacency.ts` with one declarative registry. The
// FlowRail (data side only), the CrossFlowActionsMenu, and the new
// `useFlowChain` hook all read from this map — so the "View vs Create"
// decision on CrossFlow and the resolved stage on FlowRail can never disagree.
//
// Two resolution patterns per edge:
//
//   (A) BACK_LINK — "query `to` (or its child table) for rows that reference
//       `from`." This is the dominant pattern (DN→SI, SI→PE, SO→WO, etc.).
//       The filter is on the `to` side.
//
//   (B) HEADER_LINK — "the link lives on the `from` doc's header field; read
//       it directly." Used when the current doc carries the back-pointer
//       (e.g. SO has a `quotation` header field). We still verify the
//       candidate with a cheap list query (limit 1) so the rail stays
//       consistent with reality.
//
// Contract rule 4: no invented edges. Every entry below is a real ERPNext
// field on a real doctype.
