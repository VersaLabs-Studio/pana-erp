// lib/flows/flow-link-map.ts
// Obsidian ERP v4.0 — Flow Link Map (master §12.6 + 2N Part 1.1).
//
// The single source of truth for "how to resolve a `to` document given I'm at
// a `from` document with name `X`" for every ordered doctype pair in the
// three live flows (Lead-to-Cash, Procure-to-Pay, the manufacturing spine).
//
// Replaces the ad-hoc per-page `stageStatuses` blocks and the parallel
// back-link table in `flow-adjacency.ts` with one declarative registry. The
// FlowRail (data side only), the CrossFlowActionsMenu, and the new
// `useFlowChain` hook all read from this map — so the "View vs Create"
// decision on CrossFlow and the resolved stage on FlowRail can never disagree.
//
// Three resolution patterns per edge:
//
//   (A) BACK_LINK — "query `to` (or its child table) for rows that reference
//       `from`." This is the dominant pattern (DN→SI, SI→PE, SO→WO, etc.).
//       The filter is on the `to` side.
//
//   (B) HEADER_LINK — "the link lives on the `from` doc's header field; read
//       it directly." Used when the current doc carries the back-pointer
//       (e.g. SO has a `quotation` header field). We still verify the
//       candidate with a cheap list query (limit 1) so the rail stays
//       consistent with reality.
//
//   (C) CURRENT_CHILD — "the link lives on a row in the CURRENT doc's OWN
//       child table (e.g. `Sales Order Item.prevdoc_docname`)." Used when
//       ERPNext stores the back-pointer only on a child row of the current
//       doc — there is no header field to read, and querying the *target*
//       parent's child table for it is invalid (the back-pointer child
//       table does not belong to the target). Read `currentDoc[childTable]`,
//       find the first row matching the optional `childWhere` filter, take
//       `row[childField]` as the candidate, then verify with a cheap list
//       query (limit 1) against `verifyDoctype`.
//
//       Example: Sales Order → Quotation. ERPNext stores the source Quotation
//       on `Sales Order Item.prevdoc_docname` (with `prevdoc_doctype =
//       "Quotation"`), NOT on a SO header field. Reading `so.quotation`
//       returns nothing.
//
// Contract rule 4: no invented edges. Every entry below is a real ERPNext
// field on a real doctype.
